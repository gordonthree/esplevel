WiFi enabled 3-axis accelerometer. Intended to be installed in my RV trailer so I can check how level my parking spot is from my cell phone.

Progress so far:

added more MQTT topics, now reporting RSSI and also epoch timestamp

same data is available via websocket server on port 81 

To do yet:

Need to an HTML + Javascript client page and figure out how to do the graphical representation of the accelerometer data
